# Purpose
The jupyter note book "" implements Newton's method from scratch to estimate the parameters in a simple linear regression by minimizing the sum of square error (SSE). The notebook contains the mathematical details of the Newton's method and shows implementation in python. 

# Data set
I use the IMDB movie data set from kaggle. For analysis purposes I clean the data set to only contain IMDB rating and gross sales revenue for US movies. I analyse the relationship between IMDB rating and gross sales revenue using a simple linear regression model.
