# Introduction
The "Linear Model Selection.ipynb" notebook discusses 1) Subset selection, 2) Step wise regression and 3) Shrinkage methods (lasso and ridge) for selecting from a set of linear models. These methods essentially inform of us of the predictors that should be contained in the regression for optimal model fitness.

# Data
The notebook uses school level achievement and characteristics data from New York. The data is [available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good). We use model selection methods to determine a linear model for school level math achievememnt.
