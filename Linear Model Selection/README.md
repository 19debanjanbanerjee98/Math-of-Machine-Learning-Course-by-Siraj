# Introduction
The "Linear Model Selection.ipynb" notebook discusses 1) Subset selection, 2) Step wise regression and 3) Shrinkage methods (lasso and ridge) for selecting from a set of linear models. These methods essentially inform of us of the predictors that should be contained in the regression for optimal model fitness.
