# Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj
This is a course offered by Siraj Raval on youtube about math and statistical concepts used in machine learning. 

This repository will contain my answers to the weekly homework (coding challenges) from this course. I will submit the assignments as detailed jupyter notebooks so its easy for others to go over the code.
